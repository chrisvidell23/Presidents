          <p>I believe that many things in life are achieveable as long as you do as followed</p>
          <ul>
              <li>believe in yourself</li>
              <li>work hard,what you put in more than double can be pulled out</li>
              <li>be resourceful, never second guess asking questions if you're not sure. Knowledge is power</li>
              <li> have a why! Why do you want to achieve this goal? Your why should be the fuel that keeps driving you closer and closer to your goal</li>
          </ul>
         <p>A mind is a terrible thing to waste</p>
